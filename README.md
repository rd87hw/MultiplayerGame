# MultiplayerGame
This is our multiplayer game, we created this using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
We created a maze game with 3 levels of difficulty to cater to all abilities.
We created a simple moving system using the up and down key functions.
We also have a timer so the user can see their time.

Collision was something we wanted to implement so that you couldn't just speedrun through the different difficulties. 
It resets the players position if they collide with any walls of the maze so they can try again.
